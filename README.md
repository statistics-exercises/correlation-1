# Generating pairs of random variables

In the programming exercise this week we are going to learn to sample from various joint probability distribution function.  These exercises are going to encourage you to think about what it means when we state that a pair of random variables are correlated.  In the first few exercises, however, we are going to consider how to generate a plot of two independent and uniform random variables.

If you press run on this exercise now you will see a new tab appears called `joint_uniform.png`.  If you click on this tab you will see that a graph is shown with a box.  You will observe a similar behaviour in in all of the exercises.  In all these exercises a set of lines that define a region of the xy-plane will appear when you press run.  Your task in all these exercise is thus to generate 100 randomly chosen points that fall within the region of the xy-plane that is highlighted.  The x-coordinates of these 100 points should be put within the list called `xdata`, while the y-coordinates of these points should be put within the list called `ydata`. 

For this task in particular you should generate 100 random points (x,y).  For each of these points 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1.   You should not need to use an if statement at any point during this whole exercise.
